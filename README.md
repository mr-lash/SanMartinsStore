# SanMartinsStore
 
 In this project, I analyze the sales data of the store San Martins. They sell bikes in Spain.
 
I provide an overview of some relevant key metrics and visuals (Sales, Costs, Revenue, Margin, etc) that can help the Store to gain some meaningful insights. Also I do a Geographical Overview, indicate which are the two best-performing sales agents and details about their sales.
